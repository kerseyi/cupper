# Popups and Modals

Modals are intended to be used as a quick and simple way to capture an interaction from a user. They trap the userâ€™s focus (visual and navigational) in a window that is separated from the rest of the page content, blocking access to the contents on the main page until the modal is closed by the user. These modal windows are overlaid over the main page content, trapping keyboard focus in their windows, and blurring out or dimming the main page content.
