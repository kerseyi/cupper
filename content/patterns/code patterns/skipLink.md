Skip links are a common accessibility feature on websites. They are simply shortcuts to important parts of the webpage that makes it easier and quicker for some users – especially users with disabilities – to find their way around.

Skip links are usually hidden visually by default and appear when users navigate to them using the tab key on their keyboard. “Who would ever use a keyboard to navigate?” you may ask yourself. Well, lots of people actually! For instance many users with motor or sight impairments will rely on keyboard navigation. But more on the use cases under the next heading.
